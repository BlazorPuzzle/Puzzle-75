This is a .NET 9 Blazor Web App with Global Server interactivity.
</p>

<p>
We have an EditForm to edit a model with two InputText elements, one of which we want the binding to update on every keystroke.
</p>

<p>
    With a standard input control we can do this with the syntax <code>@@bind:event="oninput"</code> but that doesn't work on an InputText. How can we achieve this?
</p>

<p>
    One solution is to subclass the InputText control like we did in the InstantInputText component.

<h3>Please tell us about yourself</h3>

<EditForm OnSubmit="SubmitForm" Model="person">
    <InputText @bind-Value="person.Name" placeholder="Name" />
    <br />
    <InstantInputText @bind-Value="person.Email" placeholder="Email" />
    <br />
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</EditForm>
<h4>@person.Email</h4>

@code {

    Person person = new();

    void SubmitForm()
    {
        // Handle the form submit here
    }

    public class Person
    {
        public string Name { get; set; } = string.Empty;
        public string Email { get; set; } = string.Empty;
    }
}
